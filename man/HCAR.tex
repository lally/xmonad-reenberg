xmonad is a tiling window manager for X. Windows are arranged
automatically to tile the screen without gaps or overlap, maximizing
screen use. Window manager features are accessible from the keyboard: a
mouse is optional. xmonad is written, configured, and extensible in
Haskell. Custom layout algorithms, key bindings, and other extensions may
be written by the user in config files. Layouts are applied
dynamically, and different layouts may be used on each workspace.
Xinerama is fully supported, allowing windows to be tiled on several
physical screens.

The new release 0.7 of xmonad added full support for the GNOME and KDE
desktops, and adoption continues to grow, with binary packages of xmonad
available for all major distributions.
