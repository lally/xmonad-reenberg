-- The 'StackSet' data type encodes a set of stacks. A given stack in the
-- set is always current. Elements may appear only once in the entire
-- stack set.
--
-- A StackSet provides a nice data structure for window managers with
-- multiple physical screens, and multiple workspaces, where each screen
-- has a stack of windows, and a window may be on only 1 screen at any
-- given time.
