== Coding guidelines for contributing to
== xmonad and the xmonad contributed extensions

* Comment every top level function, and provide a type signature, using
  haddock syntax.

* Follow the coding style of already existing modules

* Code should be compiled with -Wall and emit no errors

* Partial functions should be avoided: the window manager should not
  crash, so do not call `error` or `undefined`

* Tabs are illegal. Use 4 spaces for indenting

* Any pure function added to the core should have a QuickCheck property
  defining its behaviour

* New modules should identify the author, and have are submitted under
  the xmonad BSD3 license.
